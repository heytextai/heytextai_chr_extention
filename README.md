## Backend Implementation Notes

### Technology Stack Recommendations

- **Caching**: Redis for response caching
- **Logging**: Winston or similar for request/response logging

### Prompt Engineering for Style Enhancement

For the AI backend, you'll need to craft effective prompts to achieve good style enhancement. Here's a sample prompt structure:

```
You are an expert writing assistant. Your task is to improve the style of the following text while preserving its meaning and intent. Make it more concise, clear, and professional.

Original text:
{text}

Enhance the style of this text. Return the enhanced version along with an explanation of the changes made.
```
